                Our Story
            </h2>
            <p class="story-text">
                Dream Path was founded in 2024 with a simple yet powerful vision: to make quality education accessible to every student, regardless of their background or location. We recognized that many talented students fail to reach their full potential, not due to lack of ability, but due to lack of proper guidance and resources.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                Our journey began when we observed students struggling in grades 6-10, which directly impacted their performance in 12th standard and limited their opportunities for higher education. Similarly, we saw aspiring candidates preparing for competitive exams like TNPSC, UPSC, Bank, and Railway without access to structured study materials and proper guidance.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                Today, Dream Path serves over 10,000 students across Tamil Nadu and beyond, helping them build strong foundations and achieve their career goals. Our success rate of 95% speaks to our commitment to student success.
